# Ground-based-Cloud-Segmentation

 * FCNN (U-NET) architecture is trained (Just for an epoch) to segment a cloud region from remotely sensed optical images.<br>
 * Data reading, formatting have been taken care to execute the notebook smoothly on Colab <br>
 * If anyone have a dedicated compute resource, can run it for more number of epochs, modify the architecture.

Details of the dataset are at : https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1810/1810.05801.pdf
